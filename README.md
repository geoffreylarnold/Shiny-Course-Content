## Course Description
This course will teach students to generate interactive websites including GIS maps and other data visualizations and reports using the R programming language. The course will focus on RStudio’s Shiny web application framework for creating interactive web applications, and the Leaflet library package for mobile-friendly interactive maps. This course builds directly from its prerequisite course, Programming R for Analytics course, and offers students a chance to build skills that will be marketable in both the public and the private sectors. Students will learn to load data from a variety of sources and formats for use in interactive web interfaces that can provide real-time information, including Rest APIs.
## Course Relevance
Business Intelligence is a growing and dynamic sector. Shiny apps allow students to build comprehensive and powerful Dashboards and other kinds of web applications that can be used at firms with a variety of infrastructure.
Students will walk away from this course with at least 3 functioning examples of their achievements that they can show and demonstrate to both current and future employers.
